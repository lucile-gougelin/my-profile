				<h2>QUOTES</h2>
				<p>&#x275E; Nothing is true, everything is permitted. &#x275E; &#x2014; <i>The Creed's maxim</i></p>
				<p>&#x275E; What a terrible mistake, thought Drogo, perhaps everything is like that — we think there are beings like ourselves around us and instead there is nothing but ice and stones speaking a strange language; we are on the point of greeting a friend but our arm falls inert, the smile dies away because we are completely alone. &#x275E; &#x2014; <i>Dino Buzzati</i></p>	
				<p>&#x275E; They did not know it was impossible so they did it. &#x275E; &#x2014; <i>Mark Twain</i></p>
